        "**Q1- What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data (attributes) and methods (functions). It allows for better organization, reusability, and modularity in code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q2- What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3- What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It is a self-contained unit that bundles data (attributes/properties) and behavior (methods/functions) together.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q4-  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulatio**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Abstraction and encapsulation are both fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Abstraction\n",
        "Definition: Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Simplifies complex systems by providing a clear interface for interaction while hiding internal implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Encapsulation\n",
        "Definition: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some details.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Protects data by preventing direct modification from outside the class. It enforces controlled access through getters and setters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q4- What are dunder methods in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Dunder methods, also called magic methods or special methods, are built-in methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores (__methodname__). They are used to define the behavior of objects in different situations, such as arithmetic operations, object creation, and string representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q5- What are dunder methods in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Dunder methods, also called magic methods or special methods, are built-in methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores (__methodname__). They are used to define the behavior of objects in different situations, such as arithmetic operations, object creation, and string representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q6- Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS - Inheritance is an OOP principle that allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). This helps in code reusability and establishes a relationship between different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q7- What is polymorphism in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. The same function or method can behave differently depending on the object that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q8-  How is encapsulation achieved in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Encapsulation is an OOP principle that bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) while restricting direct access to some of the data. This helps in data protection and controlled modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q9- What is a constructor in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- A constructor is a special method in Python that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize attributes of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q10-  What are class and static methods in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- In Python, methods are functions defined inside a class. There are three types of methods in a class:\n",
        "1 Instance Methods (regular methods)\n",
        "2 Class Methods (@classmethod)\n",
        "3 Static Methods (@staticmethod)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q11- What is method overloading in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in a class. However, Python does not support traditional method overloading like Java or C++. Instead, we achieve it using default arguments or *args.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q12- What is method overriding in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Method overriding is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "A-The method in the child class must have the same name, parameters, and return type as in the parent class.\n",
        "B- It is used in inheritance to modify or extend the behavior of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q13-What is a property decorator in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- The @property decorator in Python is used to define a getter method that allows accessing a class attribute as if it were a normal attribute, without calling a method explicitly.\n",
        "\n",
        "*It allows controlled access to instance attributes.\n",
        "*It replaces traditional getter and setter methods while keeping the syntax clean.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q14-  Why is polymorphism important in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It enables a single interface to represent different data types or method implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q15-What is an abstract class in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It typically contains abstract methods, which must be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides abstract classes using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q16-  What are the advantages of OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It offers several advantages, making code more efficient, maintainable, and scalable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q17- What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), variables in a class can be classified as class variables and instance variables. They differ in scope, behavior, and storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q18- What is multiple inheritance in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS-\n",
        "\n",
        "A- Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "B- The child class gains attributes and methods from all parent classes.\n",
        "C-This increases code reusability but can introduce complexity (e.g., method resolution order).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q19- Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- In Python, both __str__ and __repr__ are dunder (double underscore) methods that define how an object is represented as a string. However, they serve different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q20- What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (superclass) within a child class. It is primarily used in inheritance to avoid redundancy and ensure that the parent class’s methods are properly executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q21- What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- The __del__ method, also known as the destructor, is a special method in Python that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q22-  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Python provides two types of methods that can be used inside a class but are not tied to an instance:\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod – A method that doesn’t use class or instance data.\n",
        "@classmethod – A method that operates on the class itself and receives cls as an argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q23- How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows the same method to have different behaviors based on the object that calls it. It enables code reusability and flexibility by allowing different classes to define their own implementations of a common method.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q24- What is method chaining in Python OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Method Chaining is a technique in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement. This is achieved by making each method return self, allowing the next method to be called on the same instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q25- What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- In Python, the __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. This makes an object callable, meaning it can behave like a function while still maintaining its state.\n"
